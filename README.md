You can use your mousepad to move the lyrics where you want then and if you click you can change the lyrics from the song. The lyrics is random so they come in a different order. 

You can describe my program as a 'lyrics-generator' with a random order of the lyrics from the same song.

//What kind of functions you have used from RiTa library?

I have not succeed in using the Rita-library so therefore there are no functions from the library in my program. Instead I have used some other functions in my program .
		 
     

//Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials?

At first it was very excited when we were going to make a program and find a text that you could decide yourself. Unfortunately the Rita-library did not work for me so that was very disappointing. I do not feel like I have got the full benefits of the miniex. 
		


//How might we think about the materiality of text/interface?
		
I think the text really opens up a discussion about how we trust printed text as a material compared to the digital literature. You can use text as a digital media since you can do a lot of different changes with it compared to a printed material. We tend to think that printed texts are more trustful since it is more difficult to change and manipulate the material than text from digital literature. 
It is also a different experience to read a digital text than a printed version with natural materials. You cannot feel the text the same way and the experience for your eyes is also different.
